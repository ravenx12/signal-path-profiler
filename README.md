# signal-path-profiler
This produces a land profile for radio signals to determine line-of sight, SRTM height data 

This project uses the SRTM work and code created by Charles Macfarlane
http://www.macfh.co.uk/JavaJive/ProgScriptWeb/SRTM.html

The srtm data tiles were downloaded from

.  Shetland Data: http://www.macfh.co.uk/JavaJive/ProgScriptWeb/SRTM3-OST50-Shetlands.zip
.  UK Data: http://www.macfh.co.uk/JavaJive/ProgScriptWeb/OS2SRTM-All.zip

These files should be unzipped and the tiles copied to the SRTM folder.  Note the UK Data zip contains tiles and programs
 but only the tiles are required for this program.
